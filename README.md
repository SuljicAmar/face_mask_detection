# Face Mask Detection

A simple example of using convolutional neural networks for face mask detection. There are three classes in total;
  - Incorrect_mask
    - Examples include mask on chin, mask on mouth but not nose
  - With_mask
  - Without_mask

I used a dataset from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shiekhburhan/face-mask-dataset?resource=download]. I used all images, complex and simple to train and evaluate this model.
